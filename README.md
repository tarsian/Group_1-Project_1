### Project Proposal
  Analyzing data on sports bets on NFL games to make predictions on which bets tend to be more accurate.
# 1. Prepare & Data Cleaning & Filtering
  With using "spreadspoke_scores.csv" information we are getting game datas from since 1966 to 2023. By easiler data finding, we cleared and filtered down to most recent 5 years data.
![Clear_5years](https://github.com/tarsian/Group_1-Project_1/assets/24801648/a3a939ef-f6a0-432a-98fa-ac788eb5514d)

# 2. Calculation & Visual Datas
  By calculating datas we have, we got datas for total # of games teams have played, team favorite picked, team total win counts, and win ratio.
