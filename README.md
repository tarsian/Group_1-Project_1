### Project Proposal
  Analyzing data on sports bets on NFL games to make predictions on which bets tend to be more accurate.
# 1. Prepare & Data Cleaning & Filtering
  With using "spreadspoke_scores.csv" information we are getting game datas from since 1966 to 2023. By easiler data finding, we cleared and filtered down to most recent 5 years data.
